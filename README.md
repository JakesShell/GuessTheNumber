# GuessTheNumber
This repository features a simple number-guessing game implemented in JavaScript. In this game, players attempt to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 100, receiving feedback on their guesses until they find the correct number.

<b>Key Features:</b>

-Random Number Generation: The game generates a random secret number between 1 and 100 at the start of each session.
-User Input: Players input their guesses through prompts, and the game provides immediate feedback.
-Input Validation: The game checks for valid numeric input, guiding users to enter a number if their guess is invalid.
-Cancellation Option: Players can cancel the game at any time, exiting with a message.

<b>How It Works:</b>

-Secret Number Creation: A random number is generated as the target for the player to guess.
-Guessing Loop: Players are prompted to guess the number, receiving feedback on whether their guess is too low, too high, or correct.
-Feedback Mechanism: The game informs players if their guess is incorrect and allows them to continue guessing until they find the secret number or cancel the game.
-End of Game: The game concludes when the correct number is guessed or the player decides to exit.
